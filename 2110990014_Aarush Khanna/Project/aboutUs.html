    <h2>About Sneakbox</h2>
        <pre>
At The Shoe Company, we believe style shouldn't demand a huge investment of
time or money. Style should be comfortable, accessible and easy to achieve.
That's why our footwear feels as good as it looks, effortlessly taking you from the
boardroom to the restaurant, to the park with your family. We strive to ensure your
shopping experience is easy on your wallet, and your schedule, by delivering fashion
and value to everyone in your household.

The first The Shoe Company opened in 1992 and the chain has since grown to more
than 115 locations across Canada.

The Shoe Company. Great brands. Smart Prices.
